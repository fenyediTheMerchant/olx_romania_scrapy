# olx_romania_scrapy

A very basic script, to Crawl trough the Romanian OLX site, and collect data from it.<br/>
THIS IS NOT A FULL FLEDGED PROJECT! Only a concept, and the basis for it.<br/>
This was written as the project part of the state examination for me (Fenyedi Levente) at the Babes-Bolyai University.<br/>
ALL DATA.JSON FILES was downloaded from the Official OLX API trough Postman, using the Developer Account given by OLX.<br/>
