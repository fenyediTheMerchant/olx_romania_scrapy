# olx_romania_scrapy

A very basic script, to Crawl trough the Romanian OLX site, and collect data from it.\n
THIS IS NOT A FULL FLEDGED PROJECT! Only a concept, and the basis for it.\n
This was written as the project part of the state examination for me (Fenyedi Levente) at the Babes-Bolyai University.\n
