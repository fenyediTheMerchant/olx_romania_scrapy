# olx_romania_scrapy

<strong>THIS IS NOT A FULL FLEDGED PROJECT!</strong> <br/>
<strong>I DO NOT CONSIDER MYSELF AS AN EXPERT PROGRAMMER!</strong> <br/><br/>
This is only a concept, and the basis for it so take it with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>
This is a very basic script, for crawling trough the Romanian OLX site, using Scrapy, and collect data from it, from given categories, and from given cities/regions (it can be used with many other parameters with little to no modifications).<br/><br/>
This was written as a representational project for my state examination at the <em>Babes-Bolyai University, FSEGA - Economic Informatics, Hungarian Department.</em><br/><br/>
<strong>ATTENTION!</strong> <BR>
All data.json files were downloaded from the <strong>Official OLX API</strong> trough Postman, using the Developer Account given by OLX.</strong><br/><br/>
