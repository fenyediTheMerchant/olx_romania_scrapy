# olx_romania_scrapy

<strong>THIS IS NOT A FULL FLEDGED PROJECT!</strong> <br/> This is only a concept, and the basis for it.<br/><br/>
A very basic script, to Crawl trough the Romanian OLX site, and collect data from it.<br/><br/>
This was written as the project part of the state examination for me (Fenyedi Levente) at the Babes-Bolyai University.<br/><br/>
<strong>ALL DATA.JSON FILES was downloaded from the Official OLX API trough Postman, using the Developer Account given by OLX.</strong><br/><br/>
